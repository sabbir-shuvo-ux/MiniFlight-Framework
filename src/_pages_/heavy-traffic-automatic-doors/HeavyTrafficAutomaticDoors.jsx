            specializes in installing and servicing heavy traffic automatic
            doors at commercial, institutional, and residential properties
            throughout New York City. Constant traffic flow can degrade door
            mechanics over time - and if thereâ€™s regular entrance and exit at
            your property by large amounts of people, your property will be best
            matched with a heavy traffic automatic door that is custom-designed
            to serve (and withstand) constant heavy traffic flow.

            preserve heated or air conditioned air in your property, and reduce
            the costs of heating and cooling your building

            <strong>Touchless Entry </strong>- Automatic doors allow people to

            preventing the spread of germs

            <strong>Convenience</strong> - Hands-free automatic entry is highly

            while their hands are occupied.
          </>,
          <>
            <strong>Traffic Control</strong> - Heavy-traffic automatic doors,
            especially high-volume revolving doors, are a fantastic solution for
            properties that receive high amounts of foot traffic. Heavy-traffic
            revolving doors allow for a constant inflow / outflow of traffic in
            and out of your property, preventing crowds and traffic jams from
            forming.
