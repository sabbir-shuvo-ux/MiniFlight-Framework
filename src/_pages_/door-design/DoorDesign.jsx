            Automatic doors work with a set of sensors, motors, and control
            systems. Sensors help to feel movement or approach towards the door,
            making the motor open or close the door. Other key elements of
            automatic doors include motion sensors, safety sensors, obstruction
            sensors, control sensors, and the door opening mechanism, which
            differs in construction based on the type of automatic door.
